# TaskFlow - GitHub Issues for Open Source Sprint 2026

## Priority: CRITICAL (Must fix first - blocks other work)

### Issue #1: Fix Race Condition in Task Status Update
**Difficulty: HIGH**
**Description:**
When multiple workers attempt to update the same task status simultaneously, there's a race condition in `TaskQueue.updateTaskStatus()`. The current implementation reads, modifies, and writes back without atomicity. This can result in lost updates or inconsistent state.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a task
2. Have 3+ workers process it simultaneously
3. Observe status updates can be lost

**Expected:** Atomic status updates using Redis transactions
**Current:** Non-atomic read-modify-write

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Use Redis WATCH/MULTI/EXEC or Lua scripts
- Add test for concurrent status updates
- No status updates should be lost

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts

---

### Issue #2: Deadlock Detection in Task Dependencies
**Difficulty: VERY HIGH**
**Description:**
When tasks form circular dependencies (A → B → C → A), the system hangs indefinitely waiting for dependencies that will never complete. There's no cycle detection in `TaskQueue._checkDependencies()`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detect circular dependencies at task creation time
- Reject tasks with cycles with clear error message
- Return HTTP 400 with cycle details
- Add DFS-based cycle detection algorithm
- Handle transitive dependencies correctly

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts, src/routes/api.ts

---

### Issue #3: Worker Crash Handling - Orphaned Tasks
**Difficulty: HIGH**
**Description:**
When a worker crashes unexpectedly, tasks assigned to it remain in "processing" state forever. They never timeout or retry. Need to implement stale task detection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detect tasks stuck in "processing" for too long
- Automatically reassign to available workers
- Add configurable timeout for stuck tasks
- Log detailed information about recovered tasks

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts, src/services/metrics-collector.ts

---

## Priority: HIGH (Important functionality)

### Issue #4: Implement Task Timeout Enforcement
**Difficulty: HIGH**
**Description:**
Tasks should automatically be killed if they exceed their timeout. Currently, `TaskExecutor.execute()` has a timeout promise, but it doesn't guarantee immediate termination of the handler function itself.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Handler execution must be forcefully terminated after timeout
- Worker resources properly cleaned up
- Task marked as failed with clear timeout error
- No resource leaks from killed tasks
- Add integration test with slow handlers

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-executor.ts, src/services/worker-pool.ts

---

### Issue #5: Redis Connection Failure Recovery
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**
If Redis temporarily disconnects, the application doesn't properly reconnect or queue operations. Current reconnection strategy only logs but doesn't retry failed operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Queue operations during disconnection
- Retry queued operations once reconnected
- Exponential backoff for reconnection
- Maximum retry limits
- Health check endpoint reports Redis status

**Files to Modify:** src/services/redis.ts, src/routes/api.ts

---

### Issue #6: Memory Leak in Metrics Snapshots
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**
`MetricsCollector` stores snapshots with TTL set to 7 days, but snapshots accumulate quickly. With many workers and queues, this can consume significant memory. Need to implement snapshot retention policy with configurable limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Limit number of stored snapshots (e.g., keep last 1000)
- Implement sliding window of metrics
- Configurable retention size and time
- Automatic cleanup of old snapshots
- Add memory usage monitoring

**Files to Modify:** src/services/metrics-collector.ts

---

### Issue #7: Task Priority Inversion Problem
**Difficulty: HIGH**
**Description:**
A low-priority task can block a high-priority task if the low-priority task is already running and there are no available workers. The queue processing in `TaskQueue.getNextTask()` doesn't account for worker availability vs. true queue position.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- High-priority tasks should preempt lower-priority ones when workers are available
- Implement priority queue correctly
- Add test showing priority task executes before queued lower-priority
- Document priority semantics

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts

---

### Issue #8: Add Distributed Lock Timeout
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**
The scheduler uses `TaskScheduler` with a 10-second lock timeout. If a scheduler process crashes while holding the lock, no other instance can acquire it for 10 seconds. Should implement automatic lock expiration with renewal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement lock renewal mechanism
- Process should renew lock before expiration
- Configurable lock TTL
- Detect crashed lock holders
- Add test for lock takeover

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-scheduler.ts

---

## Priority: MEDIUM (Nice to have, improves robustness)

### Issue #9: Implement Batch Task Creation
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**
Creating tasks one-by-one through multiple API calls is inefficient. Need bulk/batch endpoint that creates multiple tasks atomically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- POST /api/tasks/batch endpoint
- Create up to 1000 tasks in single call
- All or nothing atomic behavior
- Return array of created task IDs
- Validate all before creating any

**Files to Modify:** src/routes/api.ts, src/services/task-queue.ts

---

### Issue #10: Task Result Compression
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**
Large task results (MB-sized) stored in Redis waste memory. Should compress results using gzip before storage and decompress on retrieval.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Compress results when storing (> 10KB)
- Decompress transparently on retrieval
- Add compression ratio metrics
- Handle compression errors gracefully
- Backward compatible with uncompressed results

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts

---

### Issue #11: Implement Task Cancellation
**Difficulty: HIGH**
**Description:**
There's no way to cancel a running task. Need to implement graceful cancellation with cleanup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/cancel endpoint
- Gracefully stop execution (signal to handler)
- Cleanup worker resources
- Mark task as 'cancelled' status
- Cannot cancel already completed tasks
- Handler should check cancellation signal

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-executor.ts, src/services/task-queue.ts, src/routes/api.ts

---

### Issue #12: Add Task Rate Limiting
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configure max tasks per second per queue
- Throttle task assignment when limit reached
- Implement token bucket algorithm
- Add metrics for rate limit violations
- Configure per queue

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts, src/services/worker-pool.ts

---

### Issue #13: Implement Task Filtering in API
**Difficulty: LOW**
**Description:**
The `/api/queues/{queueName}/tasks` endpoint returns all tasks regardless of status. Need filtering by status, priority, tags, etc.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Filter by status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Filter by priority
- Filter by tags (support multiple)
- Filter by date range
- Combine multiple filters with AND logic
- Document filter syntax

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts, src/routes/api.ts

---

### Issue #14: Add Task Search by Name/Description
**Difficulty: LOW**
**Description:**
Tasks can only be retrieved by ID. Need full-text search capability for task names and descriptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GET /api/tasks/search?q=search_term endpoint
- Search across task name and description
- Case-insensitive matching
- Return matching task IDs with relevance score
- Limit results to prevent performance issues
- Handle special characters safely

**Files to Modify:** src/routes/api.ts, src/services/task-queue.ts

---

## Bug Fixes

### Issue #15: Fix Worker Status Not Updating to Idle
**Difficulty: LOW**
**Description:**
In `TaskExecutor.execute()`, finally block calls `updateWorkerStatus(..., 'idle')` after task completes. But if multiple tasks complete in quick succession, the status might be incorrectly set to idle when worker should be busy.

**Reproduction:**
1. Create worker that processes multiple tasks
2. Complete tasks rapidly
3. Check worker status in metrics

**Expected:** Status should reflect actual state

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-executor.ts

---

### Issue #16: Fix Queue Stats Not Decrementing
**Difficulty: MEDIUM**
**Description:**
In `TaskQueue.updateTaskStatus()`, when a task moves from "pending" to "queued" or "processing", the stats are never updated. The queue shows tasks as pending forever.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Update stats when task status changes
- Decrement pending count when queued
- Increment processing count when processing
- Maintain stats consistency
- Add test for stats accuracy

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts

---

### Issue #17: Fix MetricsCollector Snapshot Keys Sorting
**Difficulty: LOW**
**Description:**
In `MetricsCollector.getLatestSnapshot()`, keys are sorted lexicographically, but timestamps are still comparable this way due to numeric format. However, this approach is fragile and not guaranteed to work correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Use numeric comparison for timestamps
- Extract timestamp from key before sorting
- Add test with timestamps close together
- Document sorting behavior

**Files to Modify:** src/services/metrics-collector.ts

---

### Issue #18: Fix Task Retry Not Clearing Error Message
**Difficulty: LOW**
**Description:**
When `TaskQueue.retryTask()` creates a retry attempt, it sets `task.error = undefined`, but if the error property wasn't in the original object, this could leave undefined fields.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Delete error field properly (not set to undefined)
- Ensure clean task state before retry
- Add test for retried task error handling

**Files to Modify:** src/services/task-queue.ts

---
